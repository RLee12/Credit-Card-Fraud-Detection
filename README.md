# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Abstract

In this project, we approached the problem of exploring data and detecting fraud transaction in process of credit card. Based on exploratory data analysis, we provided a characterization of the transaction of labeled variables, bringing to the light many attributes useful to differentiate between the fraud transaction and the normal transaction. We leverage our characterization study towards a fraud detection mechanism. 

By constructing different classification models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and an ensemble of above-mentioned models, we were able to identify the fraud correctly and reduce the misclassification rate. We also investigated the tradeoff for the performance of classifications to ensure the high accuracy for real transaction. Therefore, we could see that all of our models did a good job in predicting the type of transaction and we believe our project results will help bank to detect potential fraud transaction and prevent huge financial losses.
